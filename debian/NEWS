kfreebsd-10 (10.3~svn296998-3) experimental; urgency=medium

  Loadable kernel modules are now installed to /boot/modules/, rather
  than /lib/modules/.  This ensures GRUB2 can easily load them at boot,
  even if /lib resides on a different file system.

  This change will make encrypted root filesystems more practical,
  perhaps not needing an initramfs.

  Please ensure that /boot has sufficient space, around 20-30 MiB for
  each installed kernel.

  If you have converted /lib/modules/ into a symlink to
  /boot/modules/, the package should still install correctly.
  Otherwise, installing this package will create a symlink from
  /lib/modules/* to /boot/modules/* for backward compatibility.

kfreebsd-10 (10.1~svn273581-1) experimental; urgency=high

  If upgrading to kfreebsd 10.1 from wheezy, certain userland tools
  should also be upgraded and the system rebooted so that their versions
  are in sync with the running kernel.  Known to be affected are:

  * freebsd-net-tools:
    - netstat output may be incomplete
    - ifconfig may be unable to (re)configure network interfaces
  * freebsd-smbfs: mount_smbfs may be unable to mount new filesystems
  * pf:  pfctl may be unable to modify firewall configuration

  but all should work fine after rebooting into the new kernel.
