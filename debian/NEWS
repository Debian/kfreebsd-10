kfreebsd-10 (10.1~svn273581-1) experimental; urgency=high

  If upgrading to kfreebsd 10.1 from wheezy, certain userland tools
  should also be upgraded and the system rebooted so that their versions
  are in sync with the running kernel.  Known to be affected are:

  * freebsd-net-tools:
    - netstat output may be incomplete
    - ifconfig may be unable to (re)configure network interfaces
  * freebsd-smbfs: mount_smbfs may be unable to mount new filesystems
  * pf:  pfctl may be unable to modify firewall configuration

  but all should work fine after rebooting into the new kernel.
